# Basic Radar Pi

An incredibly barebones radar and weather display, ideal of a personal Raspberry Pi kiosk.

A radar gif from [weather.gov](http://radar.weather.gov/ridge/Conus/Loop/) and yahoo weather api call is used to display a crude radar, current temperature, and current condition.

To use, set `woeid`, the gif url, and update time variables to desired values.
